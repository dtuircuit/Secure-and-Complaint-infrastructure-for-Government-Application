# Gov-Tech Project
Easily adaptable, highly secure and complaint infrastructure for governement applicate entities. 

## Overview

The Gov-Tech Project is a cloud infrastructure solution designed for a government application. This project leverages AWS services and Terraform to ensure a secure, scalable, and compliant infrastructure. The solution focuses on high availability, resilience, and robust security practices, making it suitable for critical government applications.

## Features

- **Cloud Infrastructure**: Provisioned using AWS services.
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Managed with Terraform for consistent and repeatable deployments.
- **Security**: Configured with best practices for encryption, access control, and compliance.
- **Scalability**: Designed to handle varying loads with auto-scaling and load balancing.
- **Monitoring**: Integrated with CloudWatch for real-time monitoring and alerts.

## Architecture

- **AWS Services**: Utilizes a variety of AWS services including VPC, EC2, S3, RDS, and IAM.
- **Terraform**: Infrastructure is defined and managed using Terraform scripts.
- **Networking**: Includes VPC with public and private subnets, Security Groups, and Application Load Balancers.
- **Security**: IAM roles and policies, encrypted data storage, and secure access mechanisms.
- **Monitoring**: AWS CloudWatch for monitoring and logging.
